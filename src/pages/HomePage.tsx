                Hi, I'm Arel.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I have a strong desire for creating technologies for social good.
                <br/>
                Technologies that are beneficial to everyone.
                <br/>
                Really, technologies that aren't evil.
                <br/>
                And aren't known to pull rugs.
                <br/>
                Or steal information without consent.
                <br/>
                Or exacerbate an existing digital, physical or socio-economic divide.
                <br/>
                <br/>

                To this end, I am a programmer. A backend engineer.
                I have years of experience in JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and
                Python.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                As a backend engineer, I test my own code.
                I don't wait for the Quality Engineers to test my code for me.
                <br/>
                Although doing it together is also good.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                As a backend engineer, I deploy my own code.
                Or rather, I let the CI/CD do it for me.
                <br/>
                Tinkering with the CI/CD is something I only want to do once.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                As a backend engineer, I also know a bit of frontend. lol

                <br/>
                <br/>

                And as a backend engineer, I always make sure to communicate. Two ways. In a dyadic manner. No strings attached. Kindness is free.
