            Hi, I'm Arel.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I am a backend engineer with years of experience in JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and
            Python.

            <br/>
            <br/>
            As a backend engineer, I test my own code.
            I don't wait for the Quality Engineers to test my code for me.
            <br/>
            Although doing it together is also good.

            <br/>
            <br/>
            As a backend engineer, I deploy my own code.
            Or rather, I let the CI/CD do it for me.
            <br/>
            Tinkering with the CI/CD is something I only want to do once.

            <br/>
            <br/>
            Most importantly, I have a strong desire for creating technologies for social good.
            <br/>
            Technologies that are beneficial to everyone.
            <br/>
            Really, technologies that aren't evil.
            <br/>
            And aren't known to pull rugs.
            <br/>
            Or steal information without consent.
            <br/>
            Or exacerbate an existing digital, physical or socio-economic divide.
            <br/>
            <br/>
