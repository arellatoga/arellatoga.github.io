      <p>Hi, I'm Arel.</p>
              
      <p>
        I have a strong desire for creating technologies for social good.
        Technologies that are beneficial to everyone.
        Technologies that aren't evil.
        And aren't known to pull rugs.
        Or steal information without consent.
        Or exacerbate an existing digital, physical or socio-economic divide.
        I have shown this commitment in my previous works, where I worked towards code for financial inclusion.
        I am hoping to show this further in other domains, too.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        To this end, I am a programmer. A backend engineer. I have years of experience in JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and Python.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        As a backend engineer, I test my own code. I don't wait for the Quality Engineers to test my code for me.
        Although doing it together is also good.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        As a backend engineer, I deploy my own code. Or rather, I let the CI/CD do it for me.
        Tinkering with the CI/CD is something I only want to do once.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        As a backend engineer, I also know a bit of frontend.
        This website was lovingly vibe coded with lovable.dev.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        And as a backend engineer, I always make sure to communicate. Two ways. In a dyadic manner. No strings attached. Kindness is free.
      </p>
